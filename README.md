# FirstGitHubRepo

My first time using Github to write a little message. Rock on dude. You've done more than enough and you'll continue to do so, because you're you. If we're all going to die someday, then live while you can, hurt while you can, feel alive while you can because once it's over, it's done, and you'll regret it if you don't. That's my message.
